## Core Principles at 18 Months

**Cognitive**: Transition from sensory exploration to mental representation (Piaget); learning through guided social interaction (Vygotsky)

**Emotional**: Secure attachment enables confident exploration from caregiver as safe base (Bowlby/Ainsworth)

**Psychosocial**: Asserting independence while needing boundaries; forming self-concept (Erikson)

## Integration

These theories complement each other:
- **Piaget** describes *what* cognitive abilities emerge
- **Vygotsky** explains *how* social context shapes learning
- **Attachment Theory** provides *emotional foundation* for exploration
- **Erikson** frames *psychosocial tasks* driving development

## Practical Application

At 18 months, optimal development requires:
1. Safe environment enabling autonomous exploration (Erikson + Bowlby)
2. Responsive scaffolding during challenging tasks (Vygotsky)
3. Opportunities for experimentation and problem-solving (Piaget)
4. Consistent, sensitive caregiving maintaining secure attachment (Ainsworth)
