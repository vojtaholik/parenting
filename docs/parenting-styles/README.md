# Parenting Styles

Baumrind's parenting styles framework (1966, 1971) classifies parenting approaches based on two dimensions: **warmth/responsiveness** and **control/demandingness**.

## The Four Styles

1. **[Authoritative](./authoritative.md)** - High warmth + high control (gold standard)
2. **[Authoritarian](./authoritarian.md)** - Low warmth + high control
3. **[Permissive](./permissive.md)** - High warmth + low control
4. **Uninvolved** - Low warmth + low control (see comparison matrix)

## Quick Comparison

| Style | Warmth | Control | Best For |
|-------|--------|---------|----------|
| Authoritative | High | High | Most outcomes |
| Authoritarian | Low | High | Rare exceptions |
| Permissive | High | Low | Limited contexts |
| Uninvolved | Low | Low | None |

See **[Comparison Matrix](./comparison-matrix.md)** for detailed outcomes research.

## Cultural Considerations

Baumrind's model has limitations:
- Developed from Caucasian households in Western contexts
- May not capture parenting significance across collectivist cultures
- Cultural values influence desired child-rearing outcomes
- Authoritarian parenting effects vary by cultural context

Research debate continues on cross-cultural applicability. Evaluate parenting behaviors within their cultural framework.

## Research Foundation

- **Baumrind (1966, 1967, 1971)**: Original typology defining three styles
- **Meta-analyses (2000-2020)**: Mean effect size r = .16 for parenting on academic outcomes
- **American Academy of Pediatrics**: Recommends authoritative style

## For 1.5 Year Olds

At 18 months, authoritative principles apply:
- Set clear, age-appropriate boundaries (control)
- Respond warmly to needs and emotions (warmth)
- Explain reasons in simple terms ("hot," "owie")
- Allow safe exploration within limits

Balance structure with emotional attunement during toddlerhood.
