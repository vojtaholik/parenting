# Language Development (18 Months)

## Vocabulary Explosion (18-24 Months)

### Timeline & Characteristics
- **Word spurt** occurs 15-24mo (peak ~18mo)
- 18mo: 10-50 words typical
- 24mo: 200-300 words average (minimum 50)
- Add 10-20 words/day during explosion

### Mechanisms
**Traditional theories** (phase transition):
- "Naming insight" — realizes everything has a name
- Categorization abilities emerge
- Qualitative shift in learning

**Current understanding** (computational models):
- Gradual acceleration, not sudden shift
- Result of: word repetition, simultaneous learning, varying difficulty
- Not all children show discrete "spurt"

### Key Research
- Ganger & Brent (2004): Reexamined spurt; found gradual patterns
- Individual variation in growth trajectories

## Joint Attention & Language Acquisition

### Definition & Development
- **Joint attention (JA)**: Triadic attention with person + object/event
- **Responding to JA (RJA)**: Develops first
- **Initiating JA (IJA)**: Follows

### Evidence (210 infants, 8-15mo → 16-38mo)
- RJA at 8-15mo predicts:
  - Verbal abilities at 16-38mo
  - Social responsiveness
- **Critical perspective**: JA not universal precursor; some autistic children acquire language without JA

### Practical Implication
Follow child's gaze, point to objects, narrate shared experiences.

## Hart & Risley "30 Million Word Gap"

### Original Study (1995)
- 42 Midwestern families, 2.5yr longitudinal
- **Findings**:
  - Professional families: 2,153 words/hour
  - Working-class: 1,251 words/hour
  - Welfare: 616 words/hour
  - Gap: 30M words by age 3

### Major Critiques

**Failed replication** (Sperry, Sperry, Miller):
- Low-income children hear more than H&R captured
- 5 poor/working-class communities

**Revised estimate** (2017, LENA):
- 329 families, 49,765 hours
- Gap: ~4M words by age 4 (not 30M by 3)

**Methodological issues**:
- PhD presence may suppress natural language
- Racial bias (welfare/working-class = mostly Black)
- Cultural preferences coded as "quality"

### Current Consensus (2026)
- Exact number disputed
- Environmental language exposure differences remain important
- What parents do matters, but cultural context critical

## Book Reading Interventions

### Evidence (Hirsh-Pasek, Golinkoff, Dickinson)
- **6 principles of language learning** from literature
- Shared book reading: most effective intervention (National Early Literacy Panel meta-analysis)
- Positive effects on:
  - Language abilities
  - Short/long-term learning capacity
  - Emergent literacy

### Practical Application
- Daily reading sessions
- Interactive (not passive)
- Follow child's interests
- Ask questions, expand vocabulary

## Bilingual Development

### Milestones (Simultaneous Bilingualism)
- 18mo: 50 words **combined** across both languages (minimum 15)
- Same timeline as monolingual peers
- No deficit from bilingual exposure

### Simultaneous vs Sequential
**Simultaneous (birth)**:
- Better accents
- Diversified vocabulary
- Higher grammatical proficiency
- Superior real-time processing

**Sequential (toddler+)**:
- Still effective, different trajectory

### Considerations
- High code-mixing by parents → potentially smaller vocabularies (mixed evidence)
- Early bilingual experience critical
- Children possess capacity for multiple languages

## Practical Interventions

### High-Yield Activities
1. **Narrate daily life** — name objects, actions, emotions
2. **Responsive interaction** — follow child's lead, expand utterances
3. **Read daily** — interactive, child-directed
4. **Limit screen time** — AAP: avoid <18mo (except video chat); 18-24mo: <1hr high-quality co-viewed

### Red Flags (Consult Pediatrician)
- <10 words at 18mo
- No word combinations by 24mo
- Loss of previously acquired words
- No response to name by 12mo
