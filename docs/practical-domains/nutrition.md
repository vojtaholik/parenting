# Nutrition (18 Months)

## WHO Guidelines (6-23 Months)

**Publication**: 2023 guideline supersedes earlier complementary feeding guidance.

**Age Range**: Covers complementary feeding from 6-23 months, including 18-month period.

## Responsive Feeding

**WHO Definition**: "Feeding practices that encourage the child to eat autonomously and in response to physiological and developmental needs, which may encourage self-regulation in eating and support cognitive, emotional and social development."

**Recommendation Strength**: Strong recommendation, low certainty evidence.

**Key Principles**:
- Feed consistent with child's signals of appetite and satiety
- Caregivers respond to child's hunger cues
- Encourage child to eat, not force
- Supports nutritional adequacy + cognitive/emotional/social development

**vs Scheduled Feeding**: Responsive approach prioritizes child's internal cues over rigid schedules, promoting self-regulation.

## Self-Feeding Milestones (18 Months)

### Spoon Use
- Scoops food with some loss
- Improving but not yet proficient
- Started around 12-18 months with assistance

### Fork Use
- Stabs food and brings to mouth
- Piercing mastered around 15-18 months after scooping refines
- Early introduction OK, proficiency ~18 months

### Cup Drinking
- Holds open cup independently
- Picks up, drinks, sets down with minimal spilling
- Small sip regulation develops 18-24 months

### Motor Development
- Fine motor skills improve through finger feeding
- Better hand-eye coordination
- Rapid improvement in utensil use after 12 months

**Note**: Children who self-fed earlier vs later show comparable skills by 15-18 months.

## Picky Eating

### Prevalence & Context
Common developmental phase; influenced by multiple factors (sensory, temperament, parental practices, environment).

### Evidence-Based Interventions (2023-2024 Systematic Reviews)

**Most Effective**:
1. **Taste Exposure/Repeated Exposure**: Strongest evidence. Offering unfamiliar foods repeatedly at snack times, making small pieces, using rewards/praise.
2. **Sensory-Based Interventions**: Most frequently utilized approach. Oral sensory learning in feeding.
3. **Multi-Component Approaches**: Substantial impact given multifactorial nature of picky eating.

**Moderate Evidence**:
- Nutrition education
- Parental training programs
- Flavor modification strategies

**Occupational Therapy Evidence**: Strong support for occupation-based interventions involving taste exposure for improving food acceptance and variety.

### What NOT To Do
**Avoid Coercive Practices**: Forcing, pressuring, or coercive feeding at mealtime increases resistance and pickiness.

### Family-Level Interventions
1. **Co-education**: Parent and child learning together
2. **Training**: Parental education on responsive feeding
3. **Oral Sensory Learning**: Exposure-based approaches
4. **Avoid Coercion**: Especially at mealtime

## Weaning Considerations

### AAP Guidelines (2022 Update)

**Previous (2012)**: Breastfeeding up to 1 year or longer.

**Current (2022)**: Breastfeeding for 2 years or beyond, as long as mutually desired by parent and child.

**Evidence for Extended Nursing**:

*Toddler Benefits*:
- Human milk remains significant source of macronutrients in second year
- Continues providing immunologic factors
- Offers comfort and nurture
- Immune support for growing child

*Maternal Benefits*:
- Decreased type 2 diabetes mellitus
- Lower hypertension risk
- Reduced breast cancer rates
- Reduced ovarian cancer rates

**Weaning Timing**: No specific AAP guidelines for 18-month weaning. Decision based on mutual desire of parent and child, not external pressure.

**AAP Intent**: Increase support and access to help, not apply pressure to extend breastfeeding.

## Practical Feeding Guidelines

**Complementary Foods**: Introduced ~6 months, continue through 23 months alongside milk feeds.

**Meal Patterns**: Balance structured meal/snack times with responsive feeding to internal cues.

**Food Variety**: Repeated exposure to diverse foods supports acceptance and reduces pickiness.

**Feeding Environment**: Calm, positive mealtime environment without coercion or pressure.
