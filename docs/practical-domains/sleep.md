# Sleep (18 Months)

## Sleep Requirements

**AAP/AASM Guidelines**: 11-14 hours per 24-hour period, including naps.

Naps: 1-2 hours daily, typically one afternoon nap after 2→1 transition.

## Circadian Rhythm Development

**Critical Period**: Circadian clock nearly established by 18-24 months.
- Cortisol rhythm: develops ~8 weeks
- Melatonin + sleep efficiency: ~9 weeks
- Body temperature rhythm: ~11 weeks
- Full maturation: 6-18 months → established by 1.5-2 years

**Light Exposure**: Duration >500 lx significantly predicts circadian rhythm development. Environmental cues (light-dark cycles, feeding patterns) influence circadian entrainment from 7 days postnatal.

## Nap Transition (2→1)

**Timing**: Typically 13-18 months; some ready at 12 months, others better at 16-18 months. Readiness matters more than age.

**Readiness Signs**:
- Can sustain ≥5 hours awake before/after nap
- Single nap consistently 2.5-3 hours
- Refuses one nap repeatedly

**Transition Period**: 1-2 months to fully consolidate. Daycares may transition earlier (11 months), but home transition can be later.

## Sleep Training Methods (RCT Evidence)

### Graduated Extinction (Ferber)
**RCT (2016, n=43, 6-16mo)**: Large decreases in sleep latency and night wakings vs control. No adverse stress responses or long-term effects on attachment or behavior.

**5-Year Follow-Up**: No marked long-lasting effects (positive or negative). Parents can confidently use behavioral sleep techniques.

### Full Extinction vs Gentle Methods
**Comparative Study (18-48mo)**: Bedtime fading + bedtime routine as effective as graduated extinction for reducing bedtime tantrums.

**Separation Anxiety Consideration (n=91)**: Children with high separation anxiety benefited more from "camping out" than graduated extinction.

### Long-Term Safety
**12-Month Follow-Up**: No differences in emotional/behavioral problems or attachment security between intervention groups.

## Sleep Associations & Independence

**Sleep Environment**: Consistent dark environment, appropriate temperature, safe sleep space.

**Bedtime Routine**: Consistent routine supports circadian entrainment and sleep onset.

**Sleep Independence**: Behavioral interventions effective for establishing independent sleep without long-term harm to attachment or emotional development.

## Benefits of Adequate Sleep

**AAP-Endorsed Benefits**:
- Improved attention, behavior, learning, memory
- Better emotional regulation
- Enhanced quality of life
- Better mental and physical health

**Inadequate Sleep Risks**:
- Attention, behavior, learning problems
- Increased accident/injury risk
- Higher risk of hypertension, obesity, diabetes, depression
