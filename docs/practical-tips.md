# Practical Language Tips for Parenting a Toddler (1.5yo)

Quick-reference guide for reframes and techniques. Research-backed, action-oriented.

## 1. Limit-Setting Language

### "I won't let you..." (Parent Owns the Limit)

| Instead of | Say | Why it works | Source |
|------------|-----|--------------|--------|
| "No, you can't hit" | "I won't let you hit" | Parent owns the limit; doesn't imply child incapability | RIE/Magda Gerber |
| "Don't throw food" | "I'm not okay with thrown food" | Positions boundary as parent's decision, not child's failure | RIE |
| "Stop climbing on me" | "I don't want you to climb on me right now" | Clear, respectful, non-shaming | Magda Gerber |

### Redirection with Alternatives

| Instead of | Say | Why it works |
|------------|-----|--------------|
| "No candy now" | "Let's wait to eat candy after we get home so you can brush your teeth" | Reframes "no" into "yes with conditions" |
| "Don't run inside" | "Use walking feet inside. Running is for outside" | Tells child what TO do, not what NOT to do |
| "Stop that!" | "That's not for [X]. [Y] is for [X]" | Redirects without shame |

### Choices Within Limits

```
"It's time to wash hands... I know you want to play.
We will play after you wash your hands.
Would you like to walk to the sink by yourself, or do you need help?"
```

**Why**: Offers autonomy within the non-negotiable. Age-appropriate decision-making.

## 2. Emotion Acknowledgment (Sportscasting)

Sportscasting = describing what you observe without interpretation, blame, or fixing. Uses emotionally neutral tone with curiosity.

### The "You Wanted..." Formula

| Situation | Sportscasting Phrase | Why it works |
|-----------|---------------------|--------------|
| Child crying after toy taken | "You didn't want me to take the cup away. You're really mad, mad, mad!" | Labels emotion without judgment; acknowledges desire |
| Two kids fighting over slide | "Jinny, you wanted to play on the slide by yourself. Max, you also would like time by yourself on the slide" | Describes each child's perspective without taking sides |
| Child drops something | "You were trying to hold that. It fell. You look frustrated" | Validates effort and feeling; trusts child to solve |

### Sportscasting Guidelines

- Use objective descriptors
- Avoid blame/victim language
- Don't jump in to solve
- Describe what's happening for each person
- Pause before solving problems for child

## 3. Autonomy-Preserving Phrases

### Bounded Choices

| Instead of | Say | Why it works |
|------------|-----|--------------|
| "Put your shoes on" | "Would you like to put your shoes on, or would you like me to help you?" | Gives ownership; reduces power struggle |
| "Get in the car seat" | "Do you want to climb in yourself, or would you like a boost?" | Preserves dignity during non-negotiables |

### Letting Child Try

| Instead of | Say | Why it works |
|------------|-----|--------------|
| "Be careful!" | "You can try" or [silence] | Doesn't project fear; trusts child's competence |
| "Let me do it" | "I'll help you" or "Show me what you need" | Collaborative, not takeover |
| "You'll fall!" | "You're climbing high. I'm here" | Observes without alarm |

---

## 4. Tantrum/Meltdown Language

### During Peak Meltdown: SILENCE

**Key insight**: Child's prefrontal cortex (reasoning/language center) goes offline during emotional overwhelm. Words = oxygen to fire.

**What to do**:
- Stay calm, grounded
- Turn eye gaze away (active ignoring)
- Don't speak or interact

### Minimal Phrases (If You Must Speak)

| Phrase | When to use |
|--------|-------------|
| "I'm here" | Grounding presence |
| "I love you" | Calm, slow delivery during hardest moments |
| "Let it out" | Permission to feel |
| "I'll keep you safe" | If child is flailing/risky |

### Post-Tantrum Reconnection

1. **Check readiness**: "Are you ready to talk?" (no anger/judgment)
2. **If not ready**: "You need more time. I'll check in 5 minutes"
3. **When ready**: "When you're ready, you can tell me how you feel, and we'll get through this together"

## 5. Transition Warnings

### Time Warnings

```
"In 5 minutes we'll clean up and go"
"Last one, then we're all done"
"Two more slides, then home"
```

**Why**: Toddlers can't fully grasp time, but consistent phrasing creates predictability.

### Songs/Rituals

Use same song/phrase for recurring transitions:
- Cleanup song
- Goodbye wave ritual
- "First X, then Y" formula

**Why**: Predictable structure reduces resistance.

## 6. Positive Reframes (Quick Reference)

| Common Phrase | Better Alternative | Rationale |
|---------------|-------------------|-----------|
| "Don't drip paint on the table" | "You can get newspaper to lay under your project" | Tells child what TO do |
| "Stop bossing your sister" | "I appreciate you looking out for her. Please come to me if you think she'll hurt herself" | Acknowledges intention; redirects |
| "Don't forget to wash hands" | "Please wash your hands after the restroom" | Positive instruction |
| "You can't have dessert" | "First dinner, then dessert" | Reframes as sequence, not denial |

---

## Why Toddlers Need This Language

- Under age 3, "no" is abstract; goes against developmental need for autonomy
- Telling them what TO do > what NOT to do
- RIE principle: children are capable, whole people deserving respect
- Language shapes self-concept; non-shaming boundaries preserve dignity
