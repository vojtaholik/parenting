# Circle of Security

## Overview

Attachment-based intervention developed by Cooper, Hoffman, and Powell. Teaches caregivers to recognize and respond to child's attachment needs.

## Theoretical Foundation

### Attachment Theory Application
- Secure base: support exploration
- Safe haven: comfort when distressed
- Caregiver as regulator of child's emotions
- "Being with" vs. "doing for"

## Core Concepts

### The Circle Metaphor

```
         SECURE BASE
    "I need you to..."

   Watch over me →  [TOP OF CIRCLE]
   Delight in me ↗              ↘ Support exploration
   Help organize ↑                ↓ Enjoy with me
   my feelings  ↑                  ↓
                ↑   [CHILD]        ↓

   Delight in ↖                  ↙

        SAFE HAVEN
    "Whenever I need you"
```

### Being WITH vs. Doing FOR

**Being with**: Attune to child's emotional state
- Tolerate child's emotions without fixing
- Reflective presence
- "You're frustrated the tower fell"

**Doing for**: Solve problem or regulate for child
- Sometimes necessary
- Risk: child doesn't learn self-regulation
- "Let me build it for you"

### Shark Music

Parent's own attachment history triggers misattunement:
- Avoidance of child's needs (e.g., discomfort with dependence)
- Intrusiveness (e.g., can't tolerate child's independence)
- Recognition of triggers = pathway to change

## Evidence Base

**Quality: Mixed**

### Recent RCTs (2024-2025)

**Copenhagen Study (2025)**: RCT with 297 mothers and infants (2-12 months), COS-P as adjunct to care-as-usual vs. care-as-usual alone:
- **No significant differences** in maternal sensitivity, reflective functioning, or child attachment security
- At-risk families

**Australian Study (2024-2025)**: RCT with 29 mother-toddler dyads (14-24 months), COS-P vs. PCIT-T:
- PCIT-T showed greater improvement in parenting quality and child outcomes than COS-P

### Systematic Review Findings

"Previous RCTs of COS-P have not found main effects of the intervention on interaction quality, reflective functioning, or child-caregiver attachment quality in at-risk families."

"Limitations exist in all COS-P studies to date and, viewed together, the findings are promising but hardly compelling."

### Earlier Positive Evidence

**Original Circle of Security study (2002)**: Showed changes in attachment classification from insecure to secure in some dyads.

**Head Start RCT**: Some positive effects on parenting reflective capacity.

### Current Consensus

Theoretically strong foundation in attachment science, but RCT evidence for primary outcomes (attachment security, sensitivity) remains limited and mixed, especially with at-risk populations.

## Practical Application for Toddlers

### Recognizing Needs on the Circle

**Top of circle (exploration)**:
- Toddler brings you a book, then wanders away
- Checks back visually while playing
- Response: Smile, acknowledge, let explore

**Bottom of circle (comfort)**:
- Toddler falls, cries, runs to you
- Scared of dog, clings to leg
- Response: Pick up, comfort, attune to emotion

### Common Misattunements

**Dismissing needs** (top):
- Toddler wants to show you something → "Not now, I'm busy"
- Should: Brief attention, delight

**Hovering** (top):
- Following toddler around playground when content
- Should: Step back, watch from distance

**Minimizing distress** (bottom):
- "You're fine, it's just a tiny scrape"
- Should: "That hurt! Let me see"

**Over-comforting** (bottom):
- Prolonging upset by excessive soothing
- Should: Comfort, then encourage return to play when ready

## Format

**COS-P (Parenting)**: 8-week group or individual program, DVD-based, psychoeducational

**COS-I (Intervention)**: 20-week intensive, therapist-guided, video review of parent-child interactions

## Philosophy Comparison

Most explicitly attachment-focused of the four programs. Less emphasis on independence than Montessori, more on emotional co-regulation. Overlaps with Positive Discipline's connection focus but uses different language (attachment vs. Adlerian). Compatible with RIE's observation, but emphasizes attunement over respect/autonomy.

## Cautions

- Evidence base weaker than promotional materials suggest
- More effective for motivated, lower-risk families
- Requires significant parental self-reflection
- May not address behavior management needs
