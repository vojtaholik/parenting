# Positive Discipline

## Overview

Developed by Jane Nelsen, EdD, based on Alfred Adler and Rudolf Dreikurs' Adlerian psychology. Teaches discipline that's neither permissive nor punitive.

## Theoretical Foundation

### Adlerian Principles
- Belonging and significance drive behavior
- Misbehavior = discouraged child seeking connection
- Mutual respect (kind AND firm)
- Focus on solutions, not punishment

## Core Tools for Toddlers

### Connection Before Correction
- Get down to child's level
- Empathize before problem-solving
- "You're upset the block tower fell"

### Limited Choices
- Two acceptable options
- "Red cup or blue cup?"
- Builds autonomy without power struggles

### Natural & Logical Consequences
- **Natural**: Child experiences result (wet from refusing jacket in rain)
- **Logical**: Related, respectful, reasonable (doesn't clean up toys → toys unavailable next day)
- Avoid punishment disguised as consequences

### Encouragement vs. Praise
- Effort-focused: "You worked hard on that"
- Process: "You kept trying when it was hard"
- Avoid person-focused: "You're so smart"

### Special Time
- 10-15 min daily, child-led
- Fills "connection cup"
- Reduces attention-seeking behavior

### Family/Class Meetings
- Weekly problem-solving
- Age 3+: contribute ideas
- Younger toddlers: observe routine

## Evidence Base

**Quality: Moderate**

### RCT Evidence

**Ferguson & Gfroerer (2023)**: Recent RCT provides strong support for Positive Discipline as effective parent education program.

### Earlier Studies

**School-wide implementation** (Sacramento elementary, 4-year study):
- Suspensions: 64/year → 4/year
- Vandalism: 24 episodes → 2 episodes

**Maladaptive behavior study (Nelsen, 1979)**: Statistically significant improvement in behavior vs. control schools.

### Limitations
- Limited recent (2024-2025) RCTs
- Many studies older or school-focused
- Need more toddler-specific research

## Practical Application (12-36 months)

### Developmental Adaptations
- **12-18 months**: Heavy on natural consequences, minimal language
- **18-24 months**: Limited choices, simple empathy statements
- **24-36 months**: Introduce problem-solving, increase choices

### Common Scenarios

**Hitting**:
1. Stop the hit: "I won't let you hit"
2. Empathize: "You're angry the toy was taken"
3. Redirect: "Hit this pillow" or "Use words: 'My turn'"

**Tantrums**:
1. Stay close, calm presence
2. Validate: "You're really upset"
3. Wait it out
4. Problem-solve after calm

**Refusing cooperation**:
1. Choice: "Walk or I'll carry you?"
2. When-then: "When shoes on, then we go"
3. Routine chart (visual for 2+)

## Mistaken Goals of Behavior (Adlerian)

1. **Undue attention**: Redirect to positive attention
2. **Misguided power**: Offer choices, collaboration
3. **Revenge**: Heal hurt, rebuild connection
4. **Assumed inadequacy**: Break into small steps, encouragement

## Philosophy Comparison

Overlaps heavily with authoritative parenting research. Less emphasis on attachment language than Circle of Security, more democratic than traditional discipline. Compatible with Montessori's respect for child, RIE's observation before intervention.
